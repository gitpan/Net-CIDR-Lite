Revision history for Perl extension Net::CIDR::Lite.

0.07  Wed Oct 31 10:05:00 2001
    - Lifted some code from Array::IntSpan and tweaked it for my
      purposes to do a binary search if the (# of IP addresses)/(the
      # of ranges) is below some percentage (default 4%). The initial
      search setup is still O(n*log(n)) for the sort, but it can speed up
      subsequent searches for IP addresses. I haven't benchmarked
      any of this, so for you benchmark fanatics who use this module,
      let me know some stats, please :-)
    - Added binary search capability to N::C::L find method.
    - Fixed NCL::Span find method (never trust version 1 of this stuff).
0.06  Tue Oct 30 10:05:00 2001
    - Add find methods, one for ip lookup within a single cidr object, and
      another as an Array::IntSpan style lookup, but for looking up addresses
      in labeled cidr objects. Both are moderately inefficient for looking up
      single ip addresses multiple times, but the latter is fairly efficient
      at looking up many ip addresses all at once.

    - Changed some unpack/pack code to use vec(). Thanks to Tye
      for the knowledge and know-how (especially on how to efficiently use
      the little-endian vec function on a big-endian string).
      Unpack/pack w/operations on strings is sometimes faster
      than the vec() method for some strings, but probably not
      in the common case.
0.04  Tue Oct 23 18:05:00 2001
    - bug in add_range() wasn't entering the end ip correctly.
    - added list_range() function. Not sure if its useful since
      it doesn't output ranges in CIDR netblock sizes. Could be changed
      if desired, let me know either way.
0.03  Tue Oct 23 17:05:00 2001
    - _compress_ipv6() was not stripping leading zeros within a block.
0.02  Tue Oct 23 14:45:00 2001
    - Do addition with pseudo-bit manipulation (thanks to Tye for
      initial idea, may go to complete binary operations in the future).
    - Added IPv6 support.
    - Clean up null nodes on 'as you go' on contiguous ranges (thanks
      again to Tye for the idea and directly lifted code).
    - Added more methods to simulate functionality of Net::CIDR and then
      some (e.g. added add_range() function). Still don't have
      octets function.
0.01  Tue Oct 16 09:26:01 2001
    - Basic idea to use a hash to store the ranges improves speed
      over Net::CIDR ( O(n*n) vs. O(n*log(n)) for you big O fans).
