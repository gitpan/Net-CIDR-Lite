Revision history for Perl extension Net::CIDR::Lite.

0.05  Thu Oct 25 10:05:00 2001
    - Changed some unpack/pack code to use vec(). Thanks to Tye
      for the knowledge and know-how (especially on how to efficiently use
      the little-endian vec function on a big-endian string).
      Unpack/pack w/operations on strings is sometimes faster
      than the vec() method for some strings, but probably not
      in the common case.

    - bug in add_range() wasn't entering the end ip correctly.
    - added list_range() function. Not sure if its useful since
      it doesn't output ranges in CIDR netblock sizes. Could be changed
      if desired, let me know either way.
0.03  Tue Oct 23 17:05:00 2001
    - _compress_ipv6() was not stripping leading zeros within a block.
0.02  Tue Oct 23 14:45:00 2001
    - Do addition with pseudo-bit manipulation (thanks to Tye for
      initial idea, may go to complete binary operations in the future).
    - Added IPv6 support.
    - Clean up null nodes on 'as you go' on contiguous ranges (thanks
      again to Tye for the idea and directly lifted code).
    - Added more methods to simulate functionality of Net::CIDR and then
      some (e.g. added add_range() function). Still don't have
      octets function.
0.01  Tue Oct 16 09:26:01 2001
    - Basic idea to use a hash to store the ranges improves speed
      over Net::CIDR ( O(n*n) vs. O(n*log(n)) for you big O fans).
